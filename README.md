# Skincare Sales Company Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing data from a skincare sales company. The analysis aims to provide insights into the company's performance, particularly focusing on revenue and agent data. Additionally, Microsoft Excel was used in conjunction with Python to supplement the analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Python script for data cleaning, including removing spaces in column names and renaming columns for clarity.
   - Initial data exploration and information checks.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create data visualizations.
   - Bar plots displaying total revenue by province, both in ascending and descending order, with Rupiah annotations.
   - Histogram for the distribution of 'Total Agent.'
   - Correlation matrix heatmap to identify feature relationships.

3. **Regression Analysis:**
   - Conducted linear regression analysis to understand the relationship between 'Total Agent' and 'Total Revenue.'
   - Generated scatter plots with regression lines and confidence intervals.

4. **Excel Analysis:**
   - Parallel analysis conducted in Microsoft Excel.
   - Data manipulation, sorting, filtering, and pivot tables to extract insights from the data.
   - Excel charts and graphs to visualize sales data, trends, and comparisons.

5. **Combined Insights:**
   - Insights from both Python and Excel analyses were combined to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's performance.
